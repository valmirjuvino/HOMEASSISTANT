Saving Snapshots from Cameras
Clicking on the camera button will save a single snapshot from that camera.

Clicking the record button will grab as many images as it can (based on the update intervals) for the set recording_duration

Note: This functionality is not available in native app versions (iOS & Android) and depends on the browser/device's ability to download image files.

Motion entities
Cameras can automatically be set to foccussed when motion is detected from the associated motion entities.

motion_entity can either be a single entity ID or a list of multiple entity IDs.

Note: The entities don't necessarily need to be motion sensors, they just need to be a binary sensor that is triggered when in the "on" state. E.g. a door sensor could also be used.
